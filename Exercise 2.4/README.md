## Exercise 2.4 - Django Views and Templates

Task Requirement: 
  - It’s time to create views and templates for your very own recipe web application. A custom welcome page is a good first step for any application, so that’s what you’ll focus on in this task. Feel free to be creative with your HTML knowledge when creating your custom welcome page. The task directions are as follows:

Task Directions: 

  - 1.Load Project: In VSCode, open the A2_Recipe_App/src folder.

  - 2.Create the view: Pick the app where you want to create the view. Navigate to <app>/views.py and define the view. Save the file.

  - 3.Create template:  
    a. Create a templates folder under <app> (the app name will be the app that you chose).

    b. Create a folder named <app> under the newly created templates folder.

    c. Create an HTML file to define your template. Name the file recipes_home.html. Be careful to specify the correct template path in the <app>/views.py file.
    
    d. The HTML file is currently empty. Design your welcome page using your desired elements and HTML blocks in the recipes_home.html file. Save it.
