## Exercise 2.2 - Django Project Set Up

Task Requirement: 
  - In this Achievement, you’ll recreate your Recipe application from Achievement 1. This time though, you’ll be deploying a full-fledged web application using the Django framework. Once complete, users will be able to input recipe details—ingredients, cooking times, descriptions—into the application, as well as search for recipes via their ingredients. 

In this task, you’ll set up the structure of your Recipe application project. This will be your first step towards building the application using the Django framework.

Task Directions: 

  - Create a folder in your system and name it “A2_Recipe_App”.

  - Create a virtual environment named 'a2-ve-recipeapp' and activate it. (Note: If your 'web-dev' virtual environment is still active, deactivate it before creating the new virtual environment).

  - Install Django in the virtual environment.

  - In the “A2_Recipe_App” folder in your system, create your Django project and name it “recipe_project”.
  1. Screenshot the contents and structure of the “A2_Recipe_App” folder and subfolders.
  2. Name the screenshot “proj_contents_before_renaming.jpg.”

  - Rename the “recipe_project” project directory “src”.
  1. Screenshot the contents and structure of the “A2_Recipe_App” folder and subfolders.
  2. Name the screenshot “proj_contents_after_renaming.jpg.”

  - From within the “src” folder, run migrations and then run the server. Screenshot the browser window with the success message.

  - Create superuser: Since you’ll need to log in as an admin to your application soon, it’s a good idea to create a superuser now.
  1. Create a superuser for your application following the steps in this Exercise, and use it to log in to the server in the browser.
  2. Screenshot the admin dashboard and highlight the superuser in the list of users. Save this as an image titled “admin-dashboard.jpg”. Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to quit the server.

  - Create a folder “Exercise 2.2” in your “Achievement 2” folder on GitHub.

  - Upload the “A2_Recipe_App” folder to the “Exercise 2.2” folder.

  - Create a “screenshots” sub-folder in “Exercise 2.2” and upload the screenshots from this task to it.
