## Exercise 2.1 - Getting Started with Django

Task Requirement:
  - In this first task of the second Achievement, you’ll answer a couple of questions, as well as prepare your Django development environment.


Task Directions:

  - Create a text document where you can write your answers to the following questions. You’ll want to do some research online to help you develop your answers.

  - Write two to three sentences on why Django is so popular among web developers.

  - After some research, list five large companies that use Django. Specify what the company’s product or service is and what they use Django for.

  - For each of the following scenarios, explain if you would use Django (and why or why not):
  1. You need to develop a web application with multiple users.
  2. You need fast deployment and the ability to make changes as you proceed.
  3. You need to build a very basic application, which doesn’t require any database access or file operations.
  4. You want to build an application from scratch and want a lot of control over how it works.
  5. You’re about to start working on a big project and are afraid of getting stuck and needing additional support.

  - Download and install Python (if you haven’t done so already).
  1. Run the appropriate command to check the Python version.
  2. Take a screenshot of the terminal window with the command and version and paste it into your answers document.

  - Open a new terminal window and go to the folder where you want to create your projects.

  - If you haven’t done so already, set up and create a virtual environment and name it "achievement2-practice". Then:
  1. Activate the virtual environment.
  2. Take a screenshot of the activated environment and paste it into your answers document.

  - Install Django and verify the installation by checking the version. Then:
  1. Take a screenshot of the terminal with the command and version.
  2. Paste it into your answers document.

  - Export your document as a PDF.

  - You can continue working on your learning journal! You'll update the journal for each Exercise as you move through this Achievement.

  - In the GitHub repository that you created in Achievement 1, create a folder for this Achievement (if not done already) and name it “Achievement 2”. Create a subfolder for your Exercise (“Exercise 2.1”) and upload the PDF and learning journal to this folder.
